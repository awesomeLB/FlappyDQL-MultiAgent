In the master branch, run the single player flappy bird by "python deep_q_flappy.py". Or, switch to the 
FlaPyBirdz branch and run "deep_q_flappy_mulitplayer.py". If you want to see the game rendered, set the option 
at the DISPLAY option at the top of the games/wrapped_flappy.py to True, but it will slow down training 
substantially.
